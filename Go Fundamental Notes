Variables store information to be used later
Instead of typing the same thing over again you can store it in a variable and use the variable name in it's place

Package Scope Variable
var [name] [type](int, float, string..)

Short Declaration:
[name] := [value]
 - Can only be used within a code block inside a function.
 - Type is figured out automatically


// means a comment.
 - Comments are ignored.


Signature of a Function:

func (receiver) identifier(parameters) (returns){
code block
}
 - receiver and returns are optional
 - parameters can be blank
 - when calling a function the parenthesis are required. "func()"


Strings:
 - Whatever is in a string will show up exactly how it is typed
 - strings are denoted by "" or ''
 - '' is a raw string literal

 Concatenation is using the + operator to combine things
 String Concatenation:
 - ("Hello," + argument + "!")

DATA STRUCTURES

SLICE = keep a list of values of the same type
 [][type]{[values]}
 []string{"","",""}
 - Access by index position
 - 0 based index
  [name][index #]

MAP = Stores key, value pairs
 map[key type][value type]{}
 map[string]int{"string" : int, "string" : int, "string" : int}
 - Always comes out in a random order
 - Acessed by key
 [name][key]
